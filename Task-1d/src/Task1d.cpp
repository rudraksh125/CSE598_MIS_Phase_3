/* For each frame (except the last) of the video and for each block, the program computes the difference from the same block in the next frame and then
 creates an n-bin difference histogram, by quantizing the obtained differences. The outputs, of the form
 ⟨frame id,block coord,diff comp id,pixelcount⟩ are written into a file of the form
	videofilenamediff n.dhc
