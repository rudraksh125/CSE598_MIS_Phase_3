CSE 408/598 Multimedia Information Systems
Phase #3

The Phase #3 part of the project basically helps to compare various images of a frame in a video.

System Requirements:
Python 2.7.10
OpenCV 2.4.12


Execution:
(Executions are on mac osX terminal, but it is mostly the same on every Platform.)
1. Open terminal.
2. To execute a task give python <task-name>
	for example: python task-1a.py
3. Follow the comments on the terminal for complete execution.


Explanation:
Task 1a:

Task 1b:

Task 1c: 
2D-DWT applied on every 8*8 block of the frame and n most significant wavelet components are written to a file in the form ⟨frame_id,block_coord,wavelet_comp_id,value⟩ 

Task 1d:

Task 2:
2D-DWT applied on every frame of the video and n most significant wavelet components of every frame is written to a file in the form ⟨frame_id,block_coord,wavelet_comp_id,value⟩ 

Task 3:
